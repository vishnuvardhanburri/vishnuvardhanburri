## 🧠 At a Glance
- Backend-first engineer focused on **production systems**
- Trusted with systems where **failure is expensive**
- Works mostly in **private, long-lived repos**
- Optimizes for **trust, durability, control**

---

## 🔧 What I’m Known For
- Backend architecture & long-lived services  
- Data & document pipelines (PDF, OCR, ETL)  
- AI systems with **validation, guardrails, fallbacks**  
- Stabilizing systems that already shipped  

Design priorities: **correctness · observability · maintainability**

---

## 🧑‍💻 How I Use GitHub
GitHub is my **engineering workspace**, not a portfolio.

- Architecture lives in commits  
- Decisions live in PRs  
- Repos are treated as **long-lived systems**  

Most meaningful work is private.  
Public repos show **judgment, not activity**.

---

## 🏗️ Systems I’ve Owned
- Business-critical backends  
- Multi-team APIs  
- Automation replacing fragile workflows  
- Data pipelines with zero tolerance for corruption  
- AI systems where correctness > novelty  

Success metric: the system becomes **boring to operate**.

---

## 🧭 Engineering Biases
- Clarity > cleverness  
- Simple > impressive  
- Fewer services > premature microservices  
- Explicit ownership > shared ambiguity  
- Observability is non-negotiable  
- AI assists, never decides

## 🚀 Xavira Techlabs

### Final note
No stats. No streaks. No noise.

If you’re thinking:  
**“We can’t afford to get this wrong.”**

We should talk.
