## About

Backend-first engineer focused on **production systems**.

I work on software where:
- failure is expensive,
- data is unreliable,
- dependencies are flaky,
- and requirements change mid-flight.

I don’t just ship code — I own what happens **after** it ships.

---

## What I’m Trusted With

- Backend architecture & long-lived services  
- Data & document pipelines (PDF, OCR, ETL)  
- AI-enabled systems with validation & guardrails  
- Stabilizing systems that have already shipped  

Design priorities: **correctness, observability, maintainability**.

## How I Use GitHub

GitHub is my engineering workspace.

- Architecture lives in commits  
- Decisions live in PRs  
- Systems are treated as long-lived assets  

Most meaningful work is private.  
Public repos reflect **thinking, not volume**.

---

## Systems I’ve Owned

- Business-critical backends  
- Multi-team APIs  
- Automation replacing fragile workflows  
- Data pipelines with zero tolerance for corruption  
- AI systems where correctness > novelty  

Success metric: the system becomes **boring to operate**.

## Engineering Biases

- Clarity > cleverness  
- Simple > impressive  
- Fewer services > premature microservices  
- Explicit ownership > shared ambiguity  
- Observability is non-negotiable  
- AI assists, never decides

## Xavira Techlabs

I founded **Xavira Techlabs** to build software that **keeps working after the excitement fades**.

We help teams:
- fix fragile foundations,
- correct early architectural mistakes,
- stabilize production,
- ship AI responsibly.

## Final Note

No stats. No widgets. No noise.

If you’re thinking:  
**“We can’t afford to get this wrong.”**

We should talk.
