## About Me

I’m a **backend-first senior software engineer** and **Toptal Top 3% developer** who builds, fixes, and owns **production systems**.

I work on software where failures are expensive, data is unreliable, dependencies are flaky, and requirements change mid-flight. My focus is not just shipping code, but taking responsibility for what happens **after** it ships.

I specialize in backend architecture, long-lived services, data and document pipelines, and AI-enabled systems that must behave predictably in production. I design for failure, observability, and maintainability from day one.

I don’t optimize for demos, buzzwords, or short-term velocity.  
I optimize for **trust, durability, and control**.

## How I Use GitHub

GitHub is my **engineering workspace**, not a portfolio.

- Architecture evolves through commits
- Decisions live in PRs and diffs
- Fixes are reviewed, intentional, and documented
- Repositories are treated as long-lived systems
- Most meaningful work lives in **private repositories**

Public code reflects **patterns and thinking**, not the full scope of responsibility.

## Core Technical Focus

### Backend & Systems
- Python, TypeScript, Java
- Node.js, Django, FastAPI
- REST APIs, service design, schema ownership

### Data & Pipelines
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server
- Document processing (PDF, OCR)
- ETL / workflow orchestration
- Data correctness and recovery

### AI & Automation
- LLM integrations
- RAG pipelines
- Validation, guardrails, observability
- Failure-aware automation (no silent errors)

### Infrastructure & Operations
- Docker, CI/CD
- Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean)
- Monitoring, logging, incident recovery

> Tools change. Responsibility doesn’t.

---

## Systems I’ve Owned (Representative)

- Business-critical backend platforms  
- APIs consumed by multiple teams  
- Automation replacing fragile manual or no-code workflows  
- Data pipelines with zero tolerance for corruption  
- AI systems where correctness mattered more than novelty  

Ownership included architecture, data models, deployments, rollbacks, incident response, and long-term maintenance.

A system is successful when it becomes **boring to operate**.

---

## Postmortems I’ve Learned From

- Most outages happen at boundaries, not core logic  
- Data issues cause more incidents than code bugs  
- Silent failures are worse than crashes  
- “Temporary” fixes live forever  
- AI fails confidently and incorrectly  
- Rewrites fail more often than incremental correction  
- The real cost of incidents is loss of trust  

Every system I design assumes bad input, partial failure, and future maintainers.

## Xavira Techlabs — Founder Perspective

I founded **Xavira Techlabs** to build software that **continues to work after the excitement fades**.

We help startups and enterprises:
- fix fragile foundations  
- correct early architectural mistakes  
- stabilize production systems  
- build AI features that behave predictably  

I stay hands-on where risk is highest: architecture, critical paths, reviews, and production readiness.

## Final Note

This profile is intentionally restrained.

There are no flashy widgets, activity graphs, or vanity metrics — because they don’t correlate with judgment.

If you’re reading this and thinking:

**“We can’t afford to get this wrong.”**

Then we should talk.
